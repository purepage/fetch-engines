Fetching web content can be complex. You need to handle static HTML, dynamic JavaScript-driven sites, network errors, retries, caching, and potential bot detection measures. Managing browser automation tools like Playwright adds another layer of complexity with resource pooling and stealth configurations.

`@purepageio/fetch-engines` simplifies this entire process by providing a set of robust, configurable, and easy-to-use engines for retrieving web page content.

**Why use `@purepageio/fetch-engines`?**

- **Unified API:** Get content from simple or complex sites using the same `fetchHTML(url, options?)` method.
- **Flexible Strategies:** Choose the right tool for the job:
  - `FetchEngine`: Lightweight and fast for static HTML, using the standard `fetch` API.
  - `PlaywrightEngine`: Powerful browser automation for JavaScript-heavy sites, handling rendering and interactions.
  - `HybridEngine`: The best of both worlds â€“ tries `FetchEngine` first for speed, automatically falls back to `PlaywrightEngine` for reliability on complex pages.
- **Robust & Resilient:** Built-in caching, configurable retries, and standardized error handling make your fetching logic more dependable.
- **Simplified Automation:** `PlaywrightEngine` manages browser instances and contexts automatically through efficient pooling and includes integrated stealth measures to bypass common anti-bot systems.
- **Content Transformation:** Optionally convert fetched HTML directly to clean Markdown content.
- **TypeScript Ready:** Fully typed for a better development experience.

This package provides a high-level abstraction, letting you focus on using the web content rather than the intricacies of fetching it.

## Features

- **Multiple Fetching Strategies:** Choose between `FetchEngine` (lightweight `fetch`), `PlaywrightEngine` (robust JS rendering via Playwright), or `HybridEngine` (smart fallback).
- **Unified API:** Simple `fetchHTML(url, options?)` interface across all engines.
- **Configurable Retries:** Automatic retries on failure with customizable attempts and delays.
- **Built-in Caching:** In-memory caching with configurable TTL to reduce redundant fetches.
- **Playwright Stealth:** Automatic integration of `playwright-extra` and stealth plugins to bypass common bot detection.
- **Managed Browser Pooling:** Efficient resource management for `PlaywrightEngine` with configurable browser/context limits and lifecycles.
- **Smart Fallbacks:** `HybridEngine` uses `FetchEngine` first, falling back to `PlaywrightEngine` only when needed. `PlaywrightEngine` can optionally use a fast HTTP fetch before launching a full browser.
- **Content Conversion:** Optionally convert fetched HTML directly to Markdown.
- **Standardized Errors:** Custom `FetchError` classes provide context on failures.
- **TypeScript Ready:** Fully typed codebase for enhanced developer experience.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add @purepageio/fetch-engines
# or with npm
npm install @purepageio/fetch-engines
# or with yarn
yarn add @purepageio/fetch-engines
```

If you plan to use the `PlaywrightEngine` or `HybridEngine`, you also need to install Playwright's browser binaries:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright install
# or
npx playwright install
```

## Engines

- **`FetchEngine`**: Uses the standard `fetch` API. Suitable for simple HTML pages or APIs returning HTML. Lightweight and fast.
- **`PlaywrightEngine`**: Uses Playwright to control a managed pool of headless browsers (Chromium by default via `playwright-extra`). Handles JavaScript rendering, complex interactions, and provides automatic stealth/anti-bot detection measures. More resource-intensive but necessary for dynamic websites.
- **`HybridEngine`**: A smart combination. It first attempts to fetch content using the lightweight `FetchEngine`. If that fails for _any_ reason (e.g., network error, non-HTML content, HTTP error like 403), it automatically falls back to using the `PlaywrightEngine`. This provides the speed of `FetchEngine` for simple sites while retaining the power of `PlaywrightEngine` for complex ones.

## Basic Usage

### FetchEngine

```typescript
import { FetchEngine } from "@purepageio/fetch-engines";

const engine = new FetchEngine(); // Default: fetches HTML

async function main() {
  try {
    const url = "https://example.com";
    const result = await engine.fetchHTML(url);
    console.log(`Fetched ${result.url} (ContentType: ${result.contentType})`);
    console.log(`Title: ${result.title}`);
    console.log(`Content (HTML): ${result.content.substring(0, 100)}...`);

    // Example fetching Markdown directly via constructor option
    const markdownEngine = new FetchEngine({ markdown: true });
    const mdResult = await markdownEngine.fetchHTML(url);
    console.log(`\nFetched ${mdResult.url} (ContentType: ${mdResult.contentType})`);
    console.log(`Content (Markdown):\n${mdResult.content.substring(0, 300)}...`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Fetch failed:", error);
  }
}
main();
```

### PlaywrightEngine

```typescript
import { PlaywrightEngine } from "@purepageio/fetch-engines";

// Engine configured to fetch HTML by default
const engine = new PlaywrightEngine({ markdown: false });

async function main() {
  try {
    const url = "https://quotes.toscrape.com/";

    // Example: Fetching as Markdown using per-request override
    console.log(`Fetching ${url} as Markdown...`);
    const mdResult = await engine.fetchHTML(url, { markdown: true });
    console.log(`Fetched ${mdResult.url} (ContentType: ${mdResult.contentType}) - Title: ${mdResult.title}`);
    console.log(`Content (Markdown):\n${mdResult.content.substring(0, 300)}...`);

    // You could also fetch as HTML by default:
    // const htmlResult = await engine.fetchHTML(url);
    // console.log(`\nFetched ${htmlResult.url} (ContentType: ${htmlResult.contentType}) - Title: ${htmlResult.title}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Playwright fetch failed:", error);
  } finally {
    await engine.cleanup();
  }
}
main();
```

### HybridEngine

```typescript
import { HybridEngine } from "@purepageio/fetch-engines";

// Engine configured to fetch HTML by default for both internal engines
const engine = new HybridEngine({ markdown: false });

async function main() {
  try {
    const url1 = "https://example.com"; // Simple site
    const url2 = "https://quotes.toscrape.com/"; // Complex site

    // --- Scenario 1: FetchEngine Succeeds ---
    console.log(`\nFetching simple site (${url1}) requesting Markdown...`);
    // FetchEngine uses its constructor config (markdown: false), ignoring the per-request option.
    const result1 = await engine.fetchHTML(url1, { markdown: true });
    console.log(`Fetched ${result1.url} (ContentType: ${result1.contentType}) - Title: ${result1.title}`);
    console.log(`Content is ${result1.contentType} because FetchEngine succeeded and used its own config.`);
    console.log(`${result1.content.substring(0, 300)}...`);

    // --- Scenario 2: FetchEngine Fails, Playwright Fallback Occurs ---
    console.log(`\nFetching complex site (${url2}) requesting Markdown...`);
    // Assume FetchEngine fails for url2. PlaywrightEngine will be used and *will* receive the markdown: true override.
    const result2 = await engine.fetchHTML(url2, { markdown: true });
    console.log(`Fetched ${result2.url} (ContentType: ${result2.contentType}) - Title: ${result2.title}`);
    console.log(`Content is ${result2.contentType} because Playwright fallback used the per-request option.`);
    console.log(`${result2.content.substring(0, 300)}...`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Hybrid fetch failed:", error);
  } finally {
    await engine.cleanup();
  }
}
main();
```

## Configuration

Engines accept an optional configuration object in their constructor to customise behavior.

### FetchEngine

The `FetchEngine` accepts a `FetchEngineOptions` object with the following properties:

| Option     | Type      | Default | Description                                                                                            |
| ---------- | --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `markdown` | `boolean` | `false` | If `true`, converts fetched HTML to Markdown. `contentType` in the result will be set to `'markdown'`. |

```typescript
// Example: Always convert to Markdown
const mdFetchEngine = new FetchEngine({ markdown: true });
```

### PlaywrightEngine

The `PlaywrightEngine` accepts a `PlaywrightEngineConfig` object with the following properties:

**General Options:**

| Option                  | Type      | Default  | Description                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | --------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `markdown`              | `boolean` | `false`  | If `true`, converts content (from Playwright or fallback) to Markdown. `contentType` will be `'markdown'`. Can be overridden per-request. |
| `useHttpFallback`       | `boolean` | `true`   | If `true`, attempts a fast HTTP fetch before using Playwright.                                                                            |
| `useHeadedModeFallback` | `boolean` | `false`  | If `true`, automatically retries specific failed domains in headed (visible) mode.                                                        |
| `defaultFastMode`       | `boolean` | `true`   | If `true`, initially blocks non-essential resources and skips human simulation. Can be overridden per-request.                            |
| `simulateHumanBehavior` | `boolean` | `true`   | If `true` (and not `fastMode`), attempts basic human-like interactions.                                                                   |
| `concurrentPages`       | `number`  | `3`      | Max number of pages to process concurrently within the engine queue.                                                                      |
| `maxRetries`            | `number`  | `3`      | Max retry attempts for a failed fetch (excluding initial try).                                                                            |
| `retryDelay`            | `number`  | `5000`   | Delay (ms) between retries.                                                                                                               |
| `cacheTTL`              | `number`  | `900000` | Cache Time-To-Live (ms). `0` disables caching. (15 mins default)                                                                          |
| `spaMode`               | `boolean` | `false`  | If `true`, enables Single Page Application mode. This typically bypasses `useHttpFallback`, forces `fastMode` to effectively `false`, uses more patient load conditions (e.g., network idle), and may apply `spaRenderDelayMs`. Recommended for JavaScript-heavy sites. |
| `spaRenderDelayMs`      | `number`  | `0`      | Explicit delay (ms) after page load events in `spaMode` to allow for client-side rendering. Only applies if `spaMode` is `true`. |

**Browser Pool Options (Passed to internal `PlaywrightBrowserPool`):**

| Option                     | Type                       | Default     | Description                                                               |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `maxBrowsers`              | `number`                   | `2`         | Max concurrent browser instances managed by the pool.                     |
| `maxPagesPerContext`       | `number`                   | `6`         | Max pages per browser context before recycling.                           |
| `maxBrowserAge`            | `number`                   | `1200000`   | Max age (ms) a browser instance lives before recycling. (20 mins default) |
| `healthCheckInterval`      | `number`                   | `60000`     | How often (ms) the pool checks browser health. (1 min default)            |
| `useHeadedMode`            | `boolean`                  | `false`     | Forces the _entire pool_ to launch browsers in headed (visible) mode.     |
| `poolBlockedDomains`       | `string[]`                 | `[]`        | List of domain glob patterns to block requests to.                        |
| `poolBlockedResourceTypes` | `string[]`                 | `[]`        | List of Playwright resource types (e.g., 'image', 'font') to block.       |
| `proxy`                    | `{ server: string, ... }?` | `undefined` | Proxy configuration object (see `PlaywrightEngineConfig` type).           |

### HybridEngine

The `HybridEngine` constructor accepts a single optional argument which uses the **`PlaywrightEngineConfig`** structure (see the `PlaywrightEngine` tables above). These options configure the underlying engines where applicable:

- Options like `maxRetries`, `cacheTTL`, `proxy`, `maxBrowsers`, `spaMode`, `spaRenderDelayMs`, etc., are primarily passed to the internal `PlaywrightEngine` or used by `HybridEngine` to decide its strategy.
- The `markdown` setting in the constructor (`boolean`, default: `false`) applies to **both** internal engines by default.
- The `spaMode` setting in the constructor (`boolean`, default: `false`) configures the default SPA behavior for the `HybridEngine`. If `spaMode` is true, the `HybridEngine` will attempt to detect if the `FetchEngine` result is an SPA shell (e.g., empty root div, noscript tag). If so, it will automatically fallback to `PlaywrightEngine` (with `spaMode` active) even if `FetchEngine` returned a 200 status.
- If you provide `markdown: true` or `spaMode: true` in the `options` object when calling `fetchHTML`, this override is handled as follows:
  - For `markdown`: Only applies if a fallback to `PlaywrightEngine` is necessary or if `FetchEngine` succeeded but an SPA shell was detected in `spaMode` (forcing Playwright). The `FetchEngine` part (if its result is used) will always use the `markdown` setting provided in the `HybridEngine` constructor.
  - For `spaMode`: This directly controls the `HybridEngine`'s SPA shell detection and informs the `PlaywrightEngine` if a fallback occurs.

```typescript
// Example: HybridEngine with SPA mode enabled by default
const spaHybridEngine = new HybridEngine({ spaMode: true, spaRenderDelayMs: 2000 });

async function fetchSpaSite() {
  try {
    // This will use PlaywrightEngine directly if smallblackdots is an SPA shell
    const result = await spaHybridEngine.fetchHTML("https://www.smallblackdots.net/release/16109/corrina-joseph-wish-tonite-lonely");
    console.log(`Title: ${result.title}`);
  } catch (e) { console.error(e); }
}
```

## Return Value

All `fetchHTML()` methods return a Promise that resolves to an `HTMLFetchResult` object:

- `content` (`string`): The fetched content, either original HTML or converted Markdown.
- `contentType` (`'html' | 'markdown'`): Indicates the format of the `content` string.
- `title` (`string | null`): Extracted page title (from original HTML).
- `url` (`string`): Final URL after redirects.
- `isFromCache` (`boolean`): True if the result came from cache.
- `statusCode` (`number | undefined`): HTTP status code.
- `error` (`Error | undefined`): Error object if the fetch failed after all retries. It's generally recommended to rely on catching thrown errors for failure handling.

## API Reference

### `engine.fetchHTML(url, options?)`

- `url` (`string`): URL to fetch.
- `options?` (`FetchOptions`): Optional per-request overrides.
  - `markdown?: boolean`: (Playwright/Hybrid only) Request Markdown conversion. For Hybrid, only applies on fallback to Playwright.
  - `fastMode?: boolean`: (Playwright/Hybrid only) Override fast mode.
  - `spaMode?: boolean`: (Playwright/Hybrid only) Override SPA mode behavior for this request.
- **Returns:** `Promise<HTMLFetchResult>`

Fetches content, returning HTML or Markdown based on configuration/options in `result.content` with `result.contentType` indicating the format.

### `engine.cleanup()` (PlaywrightEngine & HybridEngine)

- **Returns:** `Promise<void>`

Gracefully shuts down all browser instances managed by the `PlaywrightEngine`'s browser pool (used by both `PlaywrightEngine` and `HybridEngine`). **It is crucial to call `await engine.cleanup()` when you are finished using these engines** to release system resources.

## Stealth / Anti-Detection (`PlaywrightEngine`)

The `PlaywrightEngine` automatically integrates `playwright-extra` and its powerful stealth plugin ([`puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth`](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/tree/master/packages/puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth)). This plugin applies various techniques to make the headless browser controlled by Playwright appear more like a regular human-operated browser, helping to bypass many common bot detection systems.

There are **no manual configuration options** for stealth; it is enabled by default when using `PlaywrightEngine`. The previous options (`useStealthMode`, `randomizeFingerprint`, `evasionLevel`) have been removed.

While effective, be aware that no stealth technique is foolproof, and sophisticated websites may still detect automated browsing.

## Error Handling

Errors during fetching are typically thrown as instances of `FetchError` (or its subclasses like `FetchEngineHttpError`), providing more context than standard `Error` objects.

- `FetchError` properties:
  - `message` (`string`): Description of the error.
  - `code` (`string | undefined`): A specific error code (e.g., `ERR_NAVIGATION_TIMEOUT`, `ERR_HTTP_ERROR`, `ERR_NON_HTML_CONTENT`).
  - `originalError` (`Error | undefined`): The underlying error that caused this fetch error (e.g., a Playwright error object).
  - `statusCode` (`number | undefined`): The HTTP status code, if relevant (especially for `FetchEngineHttpError`).

Common error scenarios include:

- Network issues (DNS resolution failure, connection refused).
- HTTP errors (4xx client errors, 5xx server errors) -> `FetchEngineHttpError` from `FetchEngine` or potentially wrapped `FetchError` from `PlaywrightEngine`.
- Non-HTML content type received -> `FetchError` with code `ERR_NON_HTML_CONTENT` from `FetchEngine`.
- Playwright navigation timeouts -> `FetchError` wrapping Playwright error, often with code `ERR_NAVIGATION_TIMEOUT`.
- Proxy connection errors.
- Page crashes within Playwright.
- Errors thrown by the browser pool (e.g., failure to launch browser).

The `HTMLFetchResult` object may also contain an `error` property if the final fetch attempt failed after all retries but an earlier attempt (within retries) might have produced some intermediate (potentially unusable) result data. It's generally best to rely on the thrown error for failure handling.

**Example:**

```typescript
import { FetchEngine, FetchError } from "@purepageio/fetch-engines";

const engine = new FetchEngine();

async function fetchWithHandling(url: string) {
  try {
    const result = await engine.fetchHTML(url);
    // Note: result.error is less common, primary errors are thrown.
    if (result.error) {
      console.error(`Fetch for ${url} reported error after retries: ${result.error.message}`);
    } else {
      console.log(`Success for ${url}! Content type: ${result.contentType}`);
      // Use result.content
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Fetch failed entirely for ${url}:`);
    if (error instanceof FetchError) {
      // Handle specific FetchError codes
      switch (error.code) {
        case "ERR_HTTP_ERROR":
          console.error(`  HTTP Error: Status ${error.statusCode} - ${error.message}`);
          break;
        case "ERR_NON_HTML_CONTENT":
          console.error(`  Wrong Content Type: ${error.message}`);
          break;
        // Add other specific codes as needed
        default:
          console.error(`  FetchError (${error.code || "UNKNOWN"}): ${error.message}`);
          break;
      }
      if (error.originalError) {
        console.error(`  Original Error: ${error.originalError.message}`);
      }
    } else if (error instanceof Error) {
      // Handle generic JavaScript errors
      console.error(`  Generic Error: ${error.message}`);
    } else {
      // Handle unexpected throw types
      console.error(`  Unknown error occurred.`);
    }
  }
}

fetchWithHandling("https://example.com");
fetchWithHandling("https://httpbin.org/status/404"); // Example causing HTTP error
fetchWithHandling("https://httpbin.org/image/png"); // Example causing non-HTML error
```

## Logging

Currently, the library uses `console.warn` and `console.error` for internal warnings (like fallback events) and critical errors. More sophisticated logging options may be added in the future.
